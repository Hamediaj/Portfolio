# portfolio
Home base for all assignments

Below are the following features I added to this portfolio page:

1. The first feature I added is the ability to skip the navigation menu. I added this so that when users are using a screen recorder they have the option to skip the navigation menu.
2. The second feature I added is a better description of the alt tag for images. This is because previously my descriptions weren't really describing what the image is.
3. The third feature I added is a meaningful link. Originally for my projects page I had my link to view my project as "view my project". I fixed this and added a better description for each project link.
